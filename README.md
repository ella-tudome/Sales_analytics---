# Project Title

## Introduction
Data Mart, a global online supermarket focusing on fresh food, implemented sustainable packaging solutions in June 2020 to reduce its environmental impact. This report evaluates the impact of sustainable packaging changes on Data Mart's sales performance.

## Objective
The objective of this report is to answer the following key business questions:
- What was the quantifiable impact of the sustainable packaging changes introduced in June 2020 on Data Mart's sales performance?
- Which platforms, regions, segments, and customer types were most affected by the sustainable packaging changes?
- What strategies can Data Mart adopt to minimize the impact of future sustainability updates on sales?

## Methodology
1. Data Collection:
   - An SQL table containing weekly sales data for Data Mart was provided.
   - The data was evaluated for completeness, accuracy, and relevance.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
   - The data was cleaned and transformed to ensure it is ready for analysis.
   - Missing values were checked and addressed.
   - New columns were created for further analysis.

3. Data Analysis:
   - A before-and-after analysis was conducted to measure the impact of sustainable packaging changes on sales performance.
   - Sales data before and after the introduction of sustainable packaging was compared to identify any changes in sales patterns.

## Results
The analysis revealed the quantifiable impact of the sustainable packaging changes introduced in June 2020 on Data Mart's sales performance.
- The total number of transactions increased from 2018 to 2019 but slightly decreased in 2020.
- Oceania consistently had the highest total sales, followed by Asia and North America.
- The majority of sales were made through the retail platform, with Shopify also contributing.
- There was a slight decrease in total sales for the 4-week period after a change in 2020–06–15, and a larger decrease for the 12-week period after the change.
- When comparing sales metrics before and after the change in 2020–06–15, 2020 experienced a greater decrease in sales compared to 2018 and 2019.
- Negative impacts on sales metrics were observed in different regions, platforms, age bands, demographics, and customer types in 2020. However, Europe and the Shopify platform showed positive impacts, and new customers showed a small increase in sales.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to minimize the impact of future sustainability updates on sales:
- Conduct thorough market research.
- Communicate transparently with customers.
- Implement sustainability updates in a phased approach.
